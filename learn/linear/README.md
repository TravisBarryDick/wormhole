# Linear Method

Given data pairs *(x,y)*, the linear method learns the model vector *w* by minizing the
following objective function:

where *â„“* is the loss function such as logistic loss and hinge loss.


## Build and Run

1. First to go the root directory of `wormhole`, then build by `make linear`. It
may take several minutes in the first time due to building all dependency libraries.

2. Try a small dataset in local machine by 1 worker and 1 server:

```
tracker/dmlc_local.py -n 1 -s 1 bin/linear.dmlc learn/linear/guide/demo.conf
```

3. More documents:

- [Tutorial on using Criteo Kaggle CTR competition dataset](guide/criteo_kaggle.md)
- [Use bigger datasets](../../docs/data.md)
- [Launch jobs over multiple machines](../../docs/run.md)
